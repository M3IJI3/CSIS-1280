            <p>
                I have had many part-time job experiences and have good communication skills. 
                In addition, I have the relatively strong ability to study and to solve problems 
                because of my major. In daily life, I also can keep and maintain good relationships with 
                friends, classmates, and colleagues.

            <p>
                This is a volunteer job when I was in the university.
                My main job content is to provide study and life assistance for 
                international students from China. In addition, me and other 
                students will also actively organize and plan activities on campus.

            <br>
            <p>
                In this position, I am mainly responsible for reception, sales, 
                PC customization, and after-sales service. At the same time, 
                as a retail store of computer products, I am also mainly responsible 
                for the customer's computer maintenance and other work. The main audience
                of MSY in Australia are English-speaking customers. Therefore, during 
                my tenure, my communication and expression skills have been greatly 
                improved.
